# IAT 352 Final project: Beak & Spur

A font foundry web app created in the XAMPP development environment with PHP, MySQL, and AJAX.

In Beak & Spur, a user can:
- View and browse different font families and their characteristics like types, weights, and glyphs
- Preview how the font will look like by typing in sample text
- Filter preferred font families using different characteristics
- Register to be an app member to personalize the explore page and save favourite fonts

This web app was created, designed, and programmed by Josh Fernandez, Ethan Ma (@eathnma), and Aliasger Rasheed (@ali-rasheed).
